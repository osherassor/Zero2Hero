üìò About This Document ‚Äì A Personal Note

As someone deeply rooted in the world of cybersecurity, I believe that true expertise doesn‚Äôt start with tools or exploits ‚Äî it starts with foundations. Cybersecurity is built on understanding: how operating systems work, how memory is managed, how a packet flows through a network, how code interacts with hardware. Only when these principles are mastered can we begin to think like attackers, defenders, architects, or investigators.

This document is much more than a syllabus. It‚Äôs a personal roadmap ‚Äî a structured path I‚Äôve built out of the belief that anyone entering cybersecurity should first master the core building blocks before diving into specialized roles. For me, the essence of real cybersecurity is not superficial knowledge, but depth, clarity, and long-term growth.

In my opinion, one of the most important values in cybersecurity is the ability to learn independently. Every concept or keyword in this document can ‚Äî and should ‚Äî be further explored using tools like Google, YouTube, or AI-based assistants. This isn‚Äôt a textbook. It‚Äôs a map. And it‚Äôs up to the learner to explore each path, dig deeper, and truly own their learning process.

The first part of this syllabus covers everything I believe should be learned before touching cybersecurity itself ‚Äî the technical DNA behind the discipline. The second part dives into the core domains of cybersecurity, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, secure development, GRC, DFIR, and more ‚Äî each with detailed, actionable learning objectives.

üí¨ If you have additional suggestions, corrections, or would like to contribute videos, tutorials, or structured guides aligned with any section of this document, feel free to reach out directly. Collaboration is welcome.

This is a living project ‚Äî evolving as technology, threats, and roles evolve. I hope it helps light the path for anyone serious about mastering cybersecurity.
