# 🧠 Programming & Scripting Foundations

## 🔤 Programming Concepts Overview
- What is programming?
- Compilation vs interpretation
- Static vs dynamic typing
- Memory management basics (stack vs heap)
- Syntax, semantics, and control flow

## 💻 C/C++ Foundations
- Compilation toolchain (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Variables and data types (int, float, char, pointers)
- Control structures (if, switch, for, while, do-while)
- Functions and stack frames
- Arrays, strings, pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Memory management: malloc, free, calloc, realloc
- Structs, unions, enums
- Header files and multiple source files
- Makefiles and build systems
- Debugging with gdb

## 🔠 C# Fundamentals
- CLR and .NET overview
- Basic syntax and types
- Classes, interfaces, inheritance
- Properties, fields, and methods
- Events and delegates
- Exception handling
- LINQ basics
- Assemblies and compilation
- Windows Forms & Console Applications

## 🐚 Scripting with Bash
- Variables and quoting
- Arithmetic and string operations
- Conditional expressions (`[ ]`, `[[ ]]`)
- Looping structures (`for`, `while`, `until`)
- Functions, arguments, and return values
- Script parameters: `$1`, `$@`, `$#`
- File operations and redirection
- Automating common tasks

## 🐍 Python Fundamentals
- Syntax and indentation
- Built-in data types (int, list, dict, set)
- Flow control (if, for, while)
- Functions, modules, and packages
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Working with files and directories
- Exception handling
- Virtual environments and pip
- Modules: `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `socket`, `requests`

## ⚙️ Development Tools & Practices
- Version control: Git basics
- IDEs and text editors (VS Code, CLion, Vim, etc.)
- Command line build tools
- Basic unit testing frameworks
- Using documentation and manuals
- Reading and understanding open-source code

## 🧪 Practical Challenges
- Building a command-line calculator (C)
- File parser script (Python/Bash)
- Simulating process scheduler (C++)
- Simple REST client (C# or Python)
- Memory game or number guesser app
