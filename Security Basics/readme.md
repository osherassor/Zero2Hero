# üîê Security Basics

## üõ°Ô∏è Foundations of Security

### What is Information Security?
- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)
- Non-repudiation and Authentication
- Real-world examples of CIA violations

### Security Terminology
- Asset, Threat, Vulnerability, Exploit, Risk, Control
- Threat actor types: script kiddies, insiders, nation-states, APTs

### Security Principles
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Fail-safe defaults
- Separation of duties
- Security through obscurity (debate)

### Types of Controls
- Physical, Administrative, Technical
- Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Recovery

### Security Domains
- Physical security
- Network security
- Application security
- Endpoint security
- Data security
- Identity and access management
- Cloud security (relation to cloud foundations)

## üîç Vulnerabilities & Exposure

### Common vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations
- Unpatched systems
- Weak credentials
- Insecure defaults
- Lack of encryption

### Public databases
- CVE, CVSS scoring
- NVD, Exploit DB (overview only)

### Security misconfigurations examples
- Directory listing
- Default credentials
- Unrestricted ports/services

### Software and firmware lifecycle issues
- EOL/legacy systems
- Supply chain vulnerabilities

## üîê Authentication & Authorization Basics

### Authentication types
- Single-factor, Two-factor, MFA
- Something you know/have/are
- Passwords, OTPs, Smart cards, Biometrics

### Credential Storage Principles
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Salted hashes (bcrypt, scrypt)
- Insecure storage examples (plain text, reversible encryption)

### Authorization Models
- RBAC, ABAC, DAC, MAC
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Principle of least privilege
- Segregation of duties

## üîí Encryption Fundamentals
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
- Common algorithms: AES, RSA, ECC
- Hashing algorithms: SHA family, MD5 (deprecated)
- Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing
- SSL/TLS basics (how HTTPS works)

### Certificates and PKI
- Root, intermediate, leaf certs
- Certificate validation and revocation (CRL/OCSP)

## üìä Security Policies & Compliance

### What are security policies?
- Acceptable Use Policy
- Password Policy
- Data Retention Policy
- Remote Work Policy

### Introduction to compliance
- ISO 27001
- NIST 800-series
- SOC 2
- GDPR overview (personal data, consent, DSRs)
- HIPAA overview

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools
- Antivirus/Antimalware basics
- Host-based firewall (Windows Defender Firewall)
- File integrity monitoring
- Basic packet filtering firewalls
- Centralized log review

## üß† Mindset & Awareness
- Security as a continuous process
- Red team / blue team concepts
- Security awareness for users:
  - Phishing recognition
  - Social engineering prevention
  - Data classification and handling
