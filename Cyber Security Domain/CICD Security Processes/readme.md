# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Security Processes

## üéØ Purpose & Relevance
- Secure the entire DevOps pipeline from design to deployment  
- Reduce attack surface throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
- **Shift security left** ‚Äì embed controls at the earliest development stages  

---

## üß© Phase 1: Design Review & Architecture Security
- Understand system architecture (e.g., client-server, microservices, cloud-native)  
- Review threat modeling methodologies:
  - STRIDE
  - DREAD *(less common today)*
  - PASTA
- Analyze data flows and trust boundaries  
- Identify assets, actors, entry points, and critical paths  
- Document expected behavior and risk assumptions  

---

## üõ° Phase 2: Threat Modeling
- Define attacker profiles and motivations  
- Identify possible threats, misuse cases, and abuse cases  
- Classify risks using CVSS or internal severity models  
- Validate controls and propose mitigations

  - [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool)

## üß™ Phase 3: Development Security Practices
- Secure coding guidelines per language (e.g., .NET, Java, Python)  
- Input validation and output encoding  
- Error handling and secure logging  
- Credential management and secret rotation  
- API security: rate limiting, authentication, authorization  
- Secure session management

## üîê Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline Hardening
- Popular CI tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Azure DevOps  
- Enforce least privilege for runners and agents  
- Protect secrets and env variables with vaults:  
  - [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)  
  - [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)  
- Validate configs with Infrastructure-as-Code scanning:  
  - [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)  
  - [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec)  
- Use Software Composition Analysis tools:  
  - [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)  
  - [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)  
- Secure artifact registries: GitHub Packages, Nexus, Artifactory

## üß∞ Phase 5: Security Testing Integration
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: during commits or PRs  
- **DAST (Dynamic App Security Testing)**: against staging/pre-prod  
- **IAST (Interactive App Security Testing)**: during runtime testing  
- **IaC Scanning**: for Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm  
- **Container Image Scanning**:
  - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
  - [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)
  - [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair)

---

## üßÆ Phase 6: Security Automation & Orchestration
- Auto-fix PRs via bots  
- Pull request gates to block merges on critical issues  
- ChatOps notifications to Slack or MS Teams  
- Integration with Jira / Azure Boards  
- Weekly security trend dashboards per repo/team  

---

## üì¶ Deliverables & Documentation
- End-to-end CI/CD threat model diagrams  
- Full pipeline map: tools, runners, secrets, access levels  
- Inventory of third-party dependencies + their reviews  
- Report from scanning tools with CVSS scores and remediation  
- Executive summary on DevSecOps maturity  
- Timeline showing security improvements and milestones
