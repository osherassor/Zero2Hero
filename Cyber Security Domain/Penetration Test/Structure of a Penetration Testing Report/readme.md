  - Reconnaissance  
  - Scanning & Enumeration  
  - Exploitation  
  - Post-exploitation  
  - Reporting  
- Testing approach (black-box, white-box, grey-box)  
- Tools used (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, custom scripts)  

---

#### 🗺 5. Scope

- List of in-scope targets:  
  - IP ranges / domain names / subdomains  
  - APIs / applications / servers / devices  
  - Cloud resources (if applicable)  
- Out-of-scope components  
- Constraints or limitations (e.g., no DoS, limited time window)  
- Environment context (Production, Staging, Isolated test)  

---

#### ⚠ 6. Findings Overview Table

A table including all discovered vulnerabilities:  
- ID / Title  
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info)  
- Affected asset(s)  
- CWE/CVSS reference  
- Page or function affected  
- Remediation status (Open / Closed / Accepted Risk)  

---

#### 📌 7. Detailed Findings

Each finding should include:  
- **Title**: Clear and concise vulnerability name  
- **Severity**: Risk rating (with justification)  
- **CVE/CWE ID** (if applicable)  
- **Affected Assets**: IPs, domains, URLs  
- **Technical Description**:  
  Explain the vulnerability, how it works, and why it's a risk  
- **Evidence**:  
  - Steps to reproduce  
  - Request/response pairs  
  - Screenshots, logs, or extracted data  
- **Impact**: Business and technical implications  
- **Remediation Recommendations**:  
  - Short-term fix  
  - Long-term fix (e.g., architectural)  
  - Reference links (e.g., OWASP, NIST)

#### 🔁 8. Retesting Results (if applicable)

A section documenting:  
- Which findings were revalidated  
- Whether they were resolved or remain open  
- Date of retest and tester signature  

---

#### 🧩 9. Appendices
