## 🖥️ Thick Client Application Penetration Testing

### 🎯 Goals & Scope
- Identify vulnerabilities in desktop-based applications that interact with backend services
- Reverse engineer client logic and validate input handling
- Analyze network, file system, and memory interactions

### 🛠 Environment Preparation
- Tools: [Procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler), [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/), [.NET Reflector](https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/), [PE Studio](https://www.winitor.com/)
- Install and sandbox application (e.g., Windows VM with snapshot rollback)
- Configure intercepting proxy (mitmproxy/Fiddler) and implement SSL pinning bypass

### 🔍 Static Analysis
- Identify application tech stack: .NET, Java, C++
- Extract strings and configurations from binaries
- Analyze hardcoded credentials/API keys, obfuscated logic
- Check for local database/storage usage (e.g., SQLite, flat files, Windows Registry)

### 🏃 Dynamic Analysis
- Monitor filesystem: read/write operations, config files, logs
- Network traffic inspection: HTTP/S, SOAP, RPC, proprietary protocols
- Intercept and modify backend communication
- Test for IDORs, session handling flaws, logic errors

### 🧪 Business Logic & Functionality Testing
- Bypass client-side validations
- Abuse workflows (e.g., force elevated actions, manipulate user roles)
- Analyze verbose errors and debug outputs for leakage

### 🔓 Authentication & Authorization Testing
- Look for credentials stored in memory, files, or registry
- Session token hijacking through network interception
- Validate access control mechanisms (e.g., user vs. admin privileges)

### 🧠 Reverse Engineering
- Use disassemblers to analyze application internals
- Hook functions with [Frida](https://frida.re/) or similar tools
- Patch executables to bypass login/license verification

### 🛡 Anti-Reversing & Security Controls
- Detect and bypass anti-debugging, anti-tampering mechanisms
- Analyze obfuscation, packing, and virtualization techniques

### 🔐 Common Vulnerabilities
- Local privilege escalation via services or file permissions
- Weak or custom cryptographic implementations
- Exposure of sensitive data (tokens, secrets, logs)
- Insecure update mechanisms (e.g., no signature checks, DLL hijacking)
