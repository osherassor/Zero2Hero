# üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center (SOC)

## üè¢ SOC Fundamentals
- **Purpose and role of a SOC**
- **Types of SOCs**:  
  - Internal SOC  
  - Managed SOC (MSSP)  
  - Hybrid SOC
- **SOC tiers and responsibilities**:  
  - Tier 1: Alert triage, log monitoring  
  - Tier 2: Deep investigation, correlation  
  - Tier 3: Threat hunting, malware analysis  
- **Common roles**:  
  - SOC Analyst (L1/L2)  
  - Incident Responder  
  - SOC Engineer  
  - Threat Hunter  
  - SOC Manager

## üîç Security Monitoring & Detection
- **Key Log Sources**:  
  - Windows Event Logs  
  - Firewall and IDS logs  
  - DNS logs  
  - VPN logs  
  - Proxy/web traffic logs  

- **Detection Techniques**:
  - Use MITRE ATT&CK framework for mapping TTPs  
  - Behavioral analytics (UEBA)  
  - Signature and rule-based detections  
  - Anomaly detection and machine learning models  
  - Tuning and filtering for false positive reduction  
  - Define KPIs (e.g., MTTR, false positive rate, alert volumes)

## üö® Incident Response Process
1. **Detection and validation**  
2. **Triage and prioritization**  
3. **Containment**
   - Host isolation
   - Credential reset
   - Firewall blocks  
4. **Investigation and RCA (Root Cause Analysis)**  
5. **Eradication and recovery**  
6. **Post-incident review**: lessons learned, reporting, control updates

## üß™ Threat Hunting
- **Hypothesis-driven hunts**: based on threat intel or anomaly signals  
- **Data sources**:  
  - SIEM logs  
  - EDR telemetry  
  - NetFlow / PCAP  
- **Focus on IOAs (Indicators of Attack)** over IOCs  
- **Frameworks**: use [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) for mapping  
- **Techniques**:  
  - PowerShell script analysis  
  - Credential misuse detection  
  - Process injection identification
