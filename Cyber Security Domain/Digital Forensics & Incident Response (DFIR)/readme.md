# üîç Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

## üß≠ Introduction to DFIR
- Definition and scope of Digital Forensics and Incident Response
- Key differences between forensics and IR
- Use cases: breaches, malware, data leaks, insider threats
- Legal and ethical obligations
- Chain of custody, evidence admissibility, and documentation

---

## üíæ Digital Forensics Fundamentals
- **Sources of evidence**:
  - Memory (RAM)
  - Disks (HDD, SSD)
  - Network (packets, logs)
  - Mobile devices
  - Cloud environments

- **Acquisition Techniques**:
  - Bit-by-bit imaging: `dd`, FTK Imager, Guymager
  - Live acquisition vs dead box forensics
  - Write blockers and bypassing anti-forensics

- **Popular Tools**:
  - [Autopsy](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/)
  - [FTK](https://accessdata.com/)
  - [EnCase](https://www.guidancesoftware.com/)
  - [X-Ways Forensics](https://www.x-ways.net/)
  - [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation)
  - [Sleuth Kit](https://www.sleuthkit.org/)
  - [Plaso (log2timeline)](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso)

- **File System Analysis**:
  - NTFS, FAT32, EXT4, APFS
  - Deleted file recovery
  - Hidden partitions and artifacts

## üî¨ Memory Forensics
- Why RAM matters in incident response
- Acquisition tools:  
  - `winpmem`, `DumpIt`
- Analysis tools:  
  - [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation)  
  - [Rekall](https://github.com/google/rekall)

- What can be extracted:
  - Running processes and network connections
  - Loaded DLLs
  - Injected code and malware hooks
  - Credential artifacts (e.g., LSASS)
  - Encryption keys and logs in memory

## üñ•Ô∏è Disk & File System Analysis
- Metadata and MACB timestamps
- Hidden and slack space analysis
- Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
- File carving techniques
- File signature validation and hash matching (e.g., NSRL, VirusTotal)

---

## üåê Network Forensics
- Capturing traffic with `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`
- Protocol analysis (HTTP, DNS, SMB, FTP, TLS)
- Session reconstruction and artifact correlation
- Indicators of exfiltration and C2 communication
- Use of tools: [Arkime](https://arkime.com/), Zeek, Suricata

## üì± Mobile & Cloud Forensics

### üì± Mobile
- Acquisition types: logical, file system, physical
- Tools: Cellebrite, Magnet AXIOM, MOBILedit
- Extracting chats, GPS, call logs, browser data

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Evidence via APIs and audit logs
- Challenges: multi-tenancy, jurisdiction, volatility

## üö® Incident Response Process

### 1. Preparation
- IR policy, playbooks, escalation matrix
- Logging and alerting configuration
- Communication planning (internal/external)

### 2. Identification
- Detect anomalies via SIEM, EDR, user reports
- IOC collection: hashes, IPs, domains
- Threat triage and validation

### 3. Containment
- Short-term: isolate affected systems
- Long-term: firewall rules, patch rollout

### 4. Eradication
- Malware and backdoor removal
- Vulnerability remediation

### 5. Recovery
- System restoration
- Monitor for reinfection
- Validate business continuity

### 6. Lessons Learned
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
- Reporting to stakeholders
- Improving controls and detection rules
